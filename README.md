This is a landing page representing a Figma Land agency.

## Description

The Landing Page Project is a static website built using React, SCSS, Chakra UI and JavaScript. It features a responsive and dynamic design, with a header section showcasing the agency's logo and a navigation menu, a hero section with a background image and a call-to-action button, and several content sections highlighting the agency's destinations and services.

The website also includes a smooth scrolling effect, where clicking on a navigation link will scroll smoothly to the corresponding section on the page.

The JavaScript code for the smooth scrolling effect and the navigation menu toggle button were written from scratch.
